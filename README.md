<!-- Features -->

### Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>

The web app includes the following features:
- **Dispatch Management**: VDMS provides a centralized platform to assign vehicles to drivers, track their routes, and manage dispatch operations efficiently. Dispatchers can easily view and update the status of dispatched vehicles, ensuring seamless coordination and optimized resource allocation.

- **Fuel Usage Monitoring**: VDMS allows for accurate tracking and analysis of fuel consumption across the fleet. It provides real-time insights into fuel usage, helping organizations identify fuel-efficient vehicles, detect anomalies, and optimize fuel consumption.

- **Fuel Refill Request Management**: VDMS simplifies the fuel refill process by enabling drivers to submit refill requests through the application. Administrators receive and manage these requests, ensuring timely refills based on priority and availability.

- **Vehicle Service and Maintenance Tracking**: VDMS keeps track of service and maintenance schedules for each vehicle in the fleet. It enables users to schedule routine maintenance, record service history, and receive reminders for upcoming or overdue maintenance tasks. This proactive approach helps minimize downtime and ensures vehicles are in optimal condition.

- **Insurance Status Management**: VDMS allows users to maintain accurate and up-to-date insurance information for each vehicle. It provides a centralized repository for policy details, renewal dates, and documentation, ensuring compliance and reducing the risk of gaps in coverage.
